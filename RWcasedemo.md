PER CURIAM.



The appeal before this panel begins
with an action in the County Court filed by Plaintiff-Appellant Mr.
Tomskipetski5 against Defendant-Appellee Mr. LewisMedvedeva and the Palmer
Police Department. Before us, Mr. Tomskipetski5 sought monetary reparations, a
restatement into the department, and a reform of the police department after
being fired from an Internal Affairs Investigation. The action was dismissed
with prejudice. Consequently, Mr. Tomskipetski5 appealed, suggesting that the
judge was blinded by corruption from the Palmer Police Department High Command
and that the dismissal was not coincident with applicable case law. For the
reasons stated below, we affirm.



I



Because this case stems from a motion
to dismiss, we must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint.[1] See, e.g., *Anza v.
Ideal Steel Supply Co.,* 547 U.S. 451, 453 (2006); 



-------------------------------------
*2

*Leatherman v. Tarrant
Cty. Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit*, 507 U.S. 163, 164
(1993).  According to Tomskipetski5’s
complaint, LewisMedvedeva, Chief of the Palmer Police Department (hereinafter
PPD), placed Skipetski on administrative leave on June 11th, 2021. Medvedeva
had opted to place Skipetski on administrative leave due to an ongoing
investigation by the PPD’s Internal Affairs Unit. Four days later, Skipetski
was terminated by high command members of both the PPD and the PPD’s Internal
Affairs Unit, allegedly for “Violation of SOP,” “Violation of NDA,” and “Criminal
Offenses.”[2] 



Skipetski then filed suit in the
County Court against both Medvedeva and the PPD, alleging that his termination
was unlawful pursuant to 5 R. Stat. § 315, which allows for judicial review of
administrative actions, and 5 R. Stat. § 401, a criminal tort for official
misconduct. Medvedeva and the PPD both asserted that Skipetski’s termination
was indeed lawful, and filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim
upon which relief could be granted under Rid. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(6). In addition,
the defendants argued that various forms of relief that Skipetski requested
could not be granted under various statutes.



The County Court granted defendants’
motion to dismiss with prejudice. *Tomskipetski5 v. LewisMedvedeva, et al.*,
CCRC-CV-1308 (R.C.C. June 20th, 2021). The trial judge found that defendants
were correct in asserting that Skipetski could not base his suit off of 5 R.
Stat § 401 because official misconduct was a criminal tort. In addition, the
Court found that Skipetski had not met the pleading standard set out in *Bell
Atl. Corp. v. Twombly*, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*,
556 U.S. 662 (2009).[3] 
Skipetski promptly appealed the dismissal.



II



Rid. R. Civ. P. 9(a)(2) states that a
pleading that states a claim for relief must include “a short and plain
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” A case
may be dismissed if there is a failure to state a claim upon which relief can
be granted. Rid. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(6). The text of these rules appears verbatim
in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure at Rules 8(a)(2) and 12(b)(6),
respectively. Because both *Twombly* and *Iqbal* were based on Fed.
R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and because Rule 12(b)(6) is identical to our Rule
11(b)(6), we hold that the standard from the two cases apply to pleadings filed
with the County Court as well as motions to dismiss for failure to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 11(b)(6).



We review a dismissal for failure to
state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rid. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(6)
de novo. *Cf. Santa Fe All. for Public Health and Safety v. City of Santa Fe*,
993 F.3d 802, 811 (10th Cir. 2021). Under de novo review, we treat the issue as
if it were to be before us for the first time. “When de novo review is
compelled, no form of appellate deference is acceptable.” Salve Regina
College v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 238 (1991).



We review whether a trial judge should
have recused themselves from a case for abuse of discretion. A trial court necessarily
abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling “on an erroneous view of the law
or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” *Cooter & Gell v.
Hartmarx Corp.*, 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990).



A – *Twombly/Iqbal*



Skipetski first claims that the trial
court erred in holding that his complaint was insufficient under *Bell Atl.
Corp. v. Twombly*, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556
U.S. 662 (2009). We disagree.



Under Rid. R. Civ. P. 9(a)(2),
pleadings that state a claim must include “a short and plain statement of the
claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”



Both the parties and the trial court
have not explicitly stated what the pleading standard under Twombly and Iqbal
are. The trial court merely held that Skipetski’s complaint merely contained “a
collection of various facts.” So what does the pleading standard under those
two cases entail? 


-------------------------------
*3

Under the standard laid out in *Twombly,
supra,* and *Iqbal, supra,* to survive a motion to dismiss for failure
to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a “complaint must contain
sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is
plausible on its face.” *Wood v. Moss*, 572 U.S. 744, 757-758 (2014)
(quoting *Iqbal,* 556 U.S., at 678) (internal quotation marks omitted)). A
claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that
allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable
for the misconduct alleged. *Iqbal, supra*. The plausibility standard is
not akin to a “probability requirement,” but it asks for more than a sheer
possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. *Id.* The pleading
standard Rule 9 announces does not require detailed factual allegations, but it
demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. Id.
(quoting *Twombly,* 550 U.S., at 555). In addition, as we stated above, we
are not required to take as true legal conclusions, even those “couched as
factual allegations.” *Papasan v. Allain,* 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986),
because while legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they
must be supported by factual allegations. *Iqbal, supra*, at 679.



Furthermore, just because a plaintiff
has pleaded factual allegations that are “‘merely consistent with’ a
defendant’s liability,” that does not mean the plaintiff has met the standard
under Rule 11(b)(6). The purpose of the plausibility standard is to determine
whether a plaintiff has adequately shown (not alleged) that he is entitled to
his requested relief. See *Iqbal*, 556 U.S., at 678-679. With these points
in mind, we turn to Skipetski’s complaint.



Skipetski bases his case off of a
criminal tort statute, 5 R. Stat. § 401, and an administrative action review
tort, 5 R. Stat. § 315. As the lower court correctly recognized, Skipetski
cannot base his suit off of a criminal tort statute, because he is a private
citizen. We therefore only analyze 5 R. Stat. § 315 in his case.



5 R. Stat § 315 allows this court to
“hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, and conclusions to be…
arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance
with the law…” Thus, for Skipetski’s suit to move forward, the facts in his
complaint must demonstrate that his termination was arbitrary and capricious,
or an abuse of discretion.



The arbitrary and capricious standard
is a “narrow” one. *FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.*, 556 U.S. 502,
513 (2009). Under this standard, when an agency performs an action, it must
“examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its
action.” Id. (quoting *Motor Vehicles Mfr. Assoc. v. State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co.*, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In reviewing that explanation, we
must "consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the
relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment." Id.
(quoting *Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.*, 419
U.S. 281, 285 (1974)). We are not to substitute our judgment for the agency’s,
however, and we should “uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the
agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.” *Fox Television Studios, Inc.*,
556 U.S. at 513-514 (quoting *Bowman Transp. Inc.*, 419 U.S. at 286)).
With these notes in mind, an agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it
“relied on factors which [the county legislature] has not intended it to
consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,
offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence
before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference
in view or the product of agency expertise.” *State Farm*, 463 U.S., at
43.



Skipetski’s arguments regarding the
three reasons offered by the PPD, combined together, fall flat. Although
Skipetski seems to allege that the “criminal offenses” reason is insensible
because of the Good Samaritan Ordinance that protected the civilian he handed a
firearm to, he does not plead factual allegations that make the PPD’s view that
he violated their SOP and NDA a clear error of judgment. For one, the fact that
Skipetski released radio communication logs to a civilian without demonstrating
(or at least alleging in his complaint) that he was given consent to do so
significantly damages his case. In addition, no statute exists that would have
given Mr. Skipetski any whistleblower protection, of which he mostly bases his
argument against “Violation of NDA” on. In addition, Skipetski admits that he
violated part of the Ride Along policy enacted by the PPD, and while he
correctly points out that that alone should not result in a termination (given
that incidents like the one he described are not usually seriously damaging to
the department), the fact that he has not been able to rebut the “Violation 

------------------------------------------

*4 

of NDA” reason counsels against holding that his termination was arbitrary and
capricious.



Thus, Skipetski has not stated a claim
upon which relief can be granted in his complaint.



B – Judicial Ethics



The second issue raised on appeal is
whether the trial court dismissed the case because of judicial interference. In
other words, Appellant suggests that the judge acted unethically and/or
corruptly. Any suggestion of judicial interference is extremely concerning, and
should be taken into serious consideration—when a sufficient and logical
argument is made to establish the claim. Even if the suggestion of judicial
interference were logical, it is well established that "appellate courts
will not consider arguments not raised before trial courts." *Sims v.
Apfel*, 530 U.S. 103, 108-109 (2000). This procedural tendency “is equally
essential in order that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by final
decision there of issues upon which they have had no opportunity to introduce
evidence.” *Hormel v. Helvering*, 312 U.S. 552, 556 (1941). There is no
record of the judicial interference, corruption, or any other ethical concern
being raised by Mr. Tomskipetski5 or his counsel prior to the party. If
Appellant had come to believe that the judge was truly an agent of the Palmer
Police Department, then a recusal motion would need to have been entered into
the record: no recusal was ever filed. Instead, the entire argument of the
Appellant is centered on a hypothetical—a speculation that interference may
have occurred because one party possibly communicated with the judge after the
order. A judge is not corrupt because the judge rendered a verdict contrary to
a party. A judge is not corrupt because of a hypothetical, undeveloped, and
unsupported argument. Suggesting a judge acted unethically is, as Appellee
reminded, a grave danger and absolute risk.



III



Although we do not believe that the
trial judge undertook the appropriate analysis for the *Twombly*/*Iqbal*
standard consistent with our opinion, we agree nonetheless that the complaint
fails the standard, and that no amendment would be sufficient to correct the
deficiencies in the complaint. We therefore affirm the County Court’s dismissal
with prejudice.



It is so ordered.












­­­­*      A
majority of the judges on the panel voted to forgo oral argument. See Rid. R.
App. P. 13(a). The case was therefore submitted and decided on the briefs.  








1.    The requirement that we
accept all factual allegations as true does not extend to legal conclusions,
even those “couched as factual allegations.” Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S.
265, 286 (1986).








2.  According to the Palmer
Police Department, SOP stands for “Standard Operating Procedure.” Def.’s
Response to Pl.’s Complaint, at 2.














[3] The trial judge disposed of the pleading standard by merely stating
that Skipetski had not stated a “direct claim, [but] a collection of various
facts.” CCRC-CV-1308, at 4.
